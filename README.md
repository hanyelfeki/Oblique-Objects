# Identifying Oblique Objects in a Cartesian Mesh - C++ Code
# We will describe the main ideas of this code soon.
This version of the code is written for oblique rectangular objects but we will consider general oblique objects with arbitrary cross sections.
# The function ReadObjectInfoaAndFindMinMax is used to use the information that were passed from GUI about the rectangular oblique objects to find Xmin,Xmax,Ymin,Ymax,Zmin
